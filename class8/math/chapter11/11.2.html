      <div class="question">2. In a Television game show, the prize money of ₹ 1,00,000 is to be divided equally amongst the winners. Complete the following table and find whether the prize money given to an individual winner is directly or inversely proportional to the number of winners?</div>
      <div class="solution">
        <p>The total prize money is fixed at ₹ 1,00,000. When the number of winners increases, the prize money per winner decreases. Therefore, it is an <strong>inverse proportion</strong>.</p>
        <p>To complete the table, divide the total prize money by the number of winners:</p>
        <p>
          Number of winners: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20
        </p>
        <p>
          Prize for each winner (in ₹):
          <br>1 winner: \( \frac{1,00,000}{1} = 1,00,000 \)
          <br>2 winners: \( \frac{1,00,000}{2} = 50,000 \)
          <br>4 winners: \( \frac{1,00,000}{4} = 25,000 \)
          <br>5 winners: \( \frac{1,00,000}{5} = 20,000 \)
          <br>8 winners: \( \frac{1,00,000}{8} = 12,500 \)
          <br>10 winners: \( \frac{1,00,000}{10} = 10,000 \)
          <br>20 winners: \( \frac{1,00,000}{20} = 5,000 \)
        </p>
        <div class="final-answer">Final Answer: The prize money for each winner is <strong>inversely proportional</strong> to the number of winners. The completed table is:
