    <!-- Q1 -->
    <div class="exercise">
      <div class="question">1. The following graph shows the temperature of a patient in a hospital, recorded every hour.</div>

        <img src="13.1.1.jpg" alt="Graph for Q1 patient temperature" />
        <div class="caption">Graph 13.1.1: Patient temperature vs time.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="solution">
        <div class="part">(a) What was the patient’s temperature at 1 p.m.?</div>
        <div class="important-term">36.5°C</div>

        <div class="part">(b) When was the patient’s temperature 38.5°C?</div>
        <div class="important-term">At 12 noon</div>

        <div class="part">(d) What was the temperature at 1.30 p.m.? How did you arrive at your answer?</div>
        <div class="solution">It was <span class="important-term">36.5°C</span>. The point halfway on the x-axis between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. represents 1.30 p.m.; the y-value halfway between 36°C and 37°C gives 36.5°C.</div>

        <div class="part">(e) During which periods did the patient’s temperature show an upward trend?</div>
